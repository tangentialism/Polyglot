Here are 5 essential tips for conducting better code reviews that I've learned over the years:

1. **Start with the Big Picture**
Review the overall architecture and approach before diving into implementation details. Does the solution make sense at a high level?

2. **Be Constructive, Not Critical**
Instead of just pointing out problems, suggest improvements and share resources. Remember, code review is a learning opportunity for everyone.

3. **Focus on Important Issues**
Don't get caught up in style debates when there are more significant concerns about functionality, security, or performance. Use linters for style enforcement.

4. **Review in Small Batches**
Large PRs are overwhelming. Encourage smaller, focused changes that are easier to review thoroughly. Aim for PRs under 400 lines when possible.

5. **Ask Questions**
If something isn't clear, ask! Questions often lead to better documentation and more maintainable code.

Remember: The goal of code review is to improve code quality and share knowledge, not to prove how smart you are. #codereview #bestpractices #programming
