## Usage

### Basic Publishing

### Frontmatter Configuration

Control publishing behavior with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
tags: [smallpost, tech, discussion]
networks: [bluesky, mastodon]  # Optional: specify target networks
visibility: public             # Optional: override default visibility
---
```

### Network Selection

You can control which networks receive your post in two ways:

1. **Global Settings**: Enable/disable networks in plugin settings
2. **Per-Post Selection**: Use the `networks` frontmatter field

Available networks:
- `bluesky`
- `mastodon`
- `linkedin`

Posts will only publish to networks that are both:
- Specified in the post's `networks` field (if present)
- Enabled in plugin settings

### Content Formatting

The plugin automatically:
- Converts Obsidian-specific links (`[[]]`) to plain text
- Handles images and external links appropriately
- Preserves hashtags
- Adapts content length for platform limits:

  - Mastodon: 500 characters
  - LinkedIn: Varies by post type
